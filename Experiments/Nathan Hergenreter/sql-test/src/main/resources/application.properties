# schema.sql, but you cannot do both. Make sure to disable spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto"
# if you use schema.sql
#
# (1) create - Hibernate first drops existing tables then creates new tables
# (2) create-drop - create except the database will be dropped after all operations are completed
#     Use for testing.
# (3) update - Compares the existing schema with the object model created based on the mappings
#     It then updates the schema according to the diff. No deletions are ever made
# (4) validate - Validates whether the tables and columns exist. Otherwise throws exception
# (5) none - Turns off DDL generation
